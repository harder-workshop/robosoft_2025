# Contributing

We are pleased to offer three different ways for participants to present their work at our workshop, accommodating a range of presentation styles and formats. All submissions will be reviewed for scientific mertic and alignment with the conference themes.

1. **Poster Presentation:** We invite researchers to submit a **1-2 page abstract** (excluding references) outlining their work. Submissions will be reviewed, and accepted participants will be required to prepare a **poster presentation** using the designated template provided in the link below. This option is ideal for those who wish to share their research findings, methodologies, and results in a structured, visual format.

2. **Poster + Demonstration:** For those interested in complementing their poster with a hands-on demonstration, we encourage the submission of a **1-2 page abstract** along with a **short video** showcasing their work. The video may include **experimental results, system operations, and simulations,** providing additional insights into the research. Accepted participants will present both a **live demonstration** and a **poster**, allowing for a more interactive engagement with the audience.

3. **Demonstration Only:** If you prefer to focus solely on a live demonstration without a poster presentation, we welcome submissions in the form of a brief **video** highlighting key aspects of your work. The video may feature **experiments, system functionality, or simulations,** effectively communicating the significance of your research. Accepted participants will be given the opportunity to showcase their work through a **live demonstration** at the workshop.
