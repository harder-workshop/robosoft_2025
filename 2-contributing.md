# Contributing

We are pleased to offer two different ways for participants to present their work at our workshop, accommodating a range of presentation styles and formats. All submissions will be reviewed for scientific merit and alignment with the conference themes.

1. **Poster Presentation:** We invite researchers to submit a **1-2 page abstract** (including references) outlining their work. Submissions will be reviewed, and accepted participants will be required to prepare a **poster presentation** using the designated template. This option is ideal for those who wish to share their research findings, methodologies, and results in a structured, visual format.

2. **Poster + Demonstration:** For those interested in complementing their poster with a hands-on demonstration, we encourage the submission of a **1-2 page abstract** along with a **short video** showcasing their work. The video may include **experimental results, system operations, and simulations,** providing additional insights into the research. Accepted participants will present both a **live demonstration** and a **poster**, allowing for a more interactive engagement with the audience. 

## Submission Details

- For all submissions, please follow the [IEEE RAS template](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/files/ieeeconf.zip).
- For demo submissions, please upload your abstract and then your video as supplementary material. Video files should be no longer than 2 minutes, up to 50 mb, and in .mp4 format. The option for supplementary material will appear in the author console after submitting the abstract.
- The review process is single-blind.
- Submission and review for conference alignment will be handled through the Microsoft Conference Management Toolkit.
